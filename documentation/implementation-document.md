# Implemantation Document

## Project Structure

Application contains four main class: `HuffmanCoding`, `LZWCoding`, `CompressManagement` and `FileManagementService`. `HuffmanCoding` and `LZWCoding` are responsible for compressing and decompressing files. `CompressManagement` is responsible for managing the compression and decompression process. `FileManagementService` is responsible for reading and writing files. The GUI is implemented in `app.py`.

### Huffman Coding

The HuffmanCoding class is responsible for compressing and decompressing files using Huffman coding. The class contains the following steps:

1.
2.
3.

### LZW Coding

The LZWCoding class is responsible for compressing and decompressing files using LZW coding. The class contains the following steps:

1.
2.
3.
4.
